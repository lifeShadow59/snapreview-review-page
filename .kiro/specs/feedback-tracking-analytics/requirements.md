# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing feedback system by adding comprehensive tracking and analytics capabilities. When users interact with generated reviews (copy, language selection), the system will track these interactions for business analytics while maintaining the current user experience. The system will also implement proper feedback lifecycle management, including automatic cleanup after successful review submissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to track how many reviews are generated and copied through my feedback system, so that I can measure the effectiveness of my review collection efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Copy Review" button THEN the system SHALL increment a copy counter in the database
2. WHEN a review is copied THEN the system SHALL record the timestamp of the copy action
3. WHEN a review is copied THEN the system SHALL record the language code of the copied review from the business_language_preferences table
4. WHEN a review is copied THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing redirect to Google Reviews functionality
5. WHEN multiple users copy reviews for the same business THEN the system SHALL aggregate all copy counts accurately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want generated feedback to be automatically cleaned up after successful review submissions, so that my database doesn't accumulate unnecessary data and users get fresh reviews each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully copies a review THEN the system SHALL delete the corresponding feedback record from the database
2. WHEN feedback is deleted THEN the system SHALL preserve the analytics data (copy count, timestamp, language)
3. WHEN a user returns to generate a new review THEN the system SHALL create fresh feedback content
4. IF feedback deletion fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not interrupt the user experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate reviews in different languages based on the business's language preferences, so that I can submit reviews in my preferred language from the available options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feedback page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch language preferences from the business_language_preferences table for the specific business
2. WHEN language preferences are retrieved THEN the system SHALL display dynamic language buttons (1-3 languages) based on the business configuration
3. WHEN a user selects any language button THEN the system SHALL immediately generate new feedback in that specific language without requiring "Change Review" click
4. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL preserve the language selection for subsequent "Change Review" actions
5. WHEN a user clicks "Change Review" THEN the system SHALL regenerate feedback in the currently selected language
6. WHEN language is switched THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality (copy, redirect, tracking)
7. WHEN feedback is generated THEN the system SHALL validate that the response is in the requested language
8. IF no language preferences exist for a business THEN the system SHALL default to English language option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want access to analytics data about review generation and copying, so that I can integrate this information into my business dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN review analytics are needed THEN the system SHALL provide an API endpoint to retrieve copy statistics
2. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL return total copy count, language breakdown by language_code, and timestamp data
3. WHEN analytics data is provided THEN the system SHALL format it for easy integration with external business dashboards
4. WHEN analytics are accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure data privacy and business-specific filtering
5. WHEN no analytics data exists THEN the system SHALL return appropriate default values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for database schema changes, so that I can implement the analytics tracking in the business dashboard system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database changes are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide complete schema documentation
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include table structures, relationships, and indexes
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include sample queries for common analytics operations
4. WHEN schema changes are documented THEN they SHALL include migration scripts for existing databases
5. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL be documented with request/response examples
